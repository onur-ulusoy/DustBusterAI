# Acknowledgements

## Project Mentor

First and foremost, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude to our project mentor, [**Prof. Dr. Erdinç Altuğ**](https://web.itu.edu.tr/altuger/). His continuous support, expert guidance, and insightful criticisms have been instrumental in the conception, development, and refinement of DustBusterAI project. His passion for robotics and dedication towards educating the next generation of engineers has truly inspired us.

## Robotics Community

We would like to thank the robotics community, especially those who develop and maintain the Robot Operating System (ROS) ecosystem. This project wouldn't have been possible without their groundbreaking work. We have benefited enormously from open-source packages such as SLAM, Nav2, and Cartographer. These packages laid the groundwork for our robot's navigational and perception capabilities.

## Artwork Owners

We are thankful to the following artists for their icons and AI services which greatly helped in creating an attractive and understandable documentation:

- [Stockio - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/radar) for radar icons.
- [mynamepong - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/chart) for chart icons.
- [netscript - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/strategy) for strategy icons.
- [rizky maulidhani - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/route) for route icons.
