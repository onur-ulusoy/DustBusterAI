# Pathfinding Options for a ROS2 Diff Drive Robot

This document compares two approaches for pathfinding in a ROS2 diff_drive robot that uses lidar for sensing the environment.

## Option 1: Implement A* Algorithm with Your Existing diff_drive Script and Hand-Written Plugins

### Pros

- Control over the implementation, allowing for customization of the pathfinding algorithm to better suit specific needs.
- Potentially more lightweight than a full SLAM solution, as it only focuses on pathfinding.

### Cons

- Need to handle mapping and localization aspects, which can be time-consuming and challenging.
- Performance of the pathfinding algorithm depends on the quality of input data (lidar data and map representation).

## Option 2: Use a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Solution

### Pros

- SLAM solutions typically come with built-in pathfinding algorithms, eliminating the need to implement the A* algorithm.
- SLAM takes care of both mapping and localization, providing a more complete solution.

### Cons

- SLAM can be more computationally expensive than a standalone pathfinding algorithm, especially on resource-constrained platforms.
- SLAM solutions might be harder to customize to fit specific needs.

## Conclusion

- If the primary goal is learning and there is no concern about computational complexity or having an all-in-one solution, implementing the A* algorithm with the existing diff_drive plugin might be a good choice. This approach will provide a better understanding of pathfinding algorithms and how they work with specific hardware.
- If the goal is to have a complete, efficient, and ready-to-use solution for navigation, SLAM might be a better choice. SLAM solutions like ROS2 Navigation2 or SLAM Toolbox already have pathfinding algorithms, mapping, and localization integrated, and they are widely used in the robotics community. This option saves time and effort in implementation, allowing focus on other aspects of the project.
