## Project Overview
DustBuster is an AI-powered full autonomous differential vehicled robot that is designed to clean plain floors in wide areas such as airports in the possible shortest period of time. DustBuster is equipped with advanced path planning, decision-making, and optimal motion control algorithms that enable it to navigate through complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Its powerful electric motors and durable wheels allow it to move quickly and efficiently across large areas, while its integrated cleaning system ensures that every nook and cranny is thoroughly cleaned. Vehicle electronics including hardware, firmwares, and sensor system is designed with efficiency and reliability in mind, as the robot needs to be able to operate for extended periods of time without interruptions. This requires careful power management and fault tolerance design.

DustBusterAI uses the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), the well known and effective framework, to implement AI-based cleaning solutions for the robot. It employs simulation and monitoring platforms, Gazebo and RViz, for efficient development. 

In addition to its autonomous capabilities, DustBuster also offers a range of features that make it easy to use and maintain. Its intuitive interface allows operators to monitor its progress and adjust settings as needed, while its modular design makes it easy to replace worn components and perform routine maintenance tasks.

Overall, DustBuster represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous cleaning robots, offering a powerful, efficient, and user-friendly solution for cleaning large areas quickly and effectively.

## Project Challenges
The DustBusterAI project faces several difficulty, including:

- Lack of funding to the project delays in procuring or manufacturing necessary components and materials
- Difficulty in optimizing the robot's navigation and cleaning algorithms to improve efficiency and effectiveness
- Market competition from other cleaning robots and devices

## Project Status
As of March 25, 2023, the DustBusterAI project is in the design and planning phase. The team is currently working on developing the robot's decision making algorithms and testing using ROS2 framework, in Gazebo and RViz platforms. The project is on track to meet its Q1 2023 deadline for completing the prototype.

## Pre Simulations
Since most of the algorithms are handled by development team, before creating ROS environment or investing resources into building a physical prototype of a robot, it's crucial to validate the underlying algorithms that will govern its behavior. This involves simulating the robot's movements and interactions with the environment to verify that the algorithms are functioning as intended. Unity, a popular game engine and simulation platform, provides a powerful toolset for creating these simulations. By building a virtual prototype in Unity, developers can test and refine the algorithms that will ultimately drive the physical robot's behavior, without the risks and expenses associated with building and testing a physical prototype. This can help to identify and resolve potential issues early on in the development process, ensuring that the final product is as efficient and effective as possible. Once the algorithms have been thoroughly tested and optimized in the Unity simulation, developers can confidently move forward with building the physical robot.

Algorithms first tested in Unity Engine and this is the main repository, not contain much another code, that's why the project is seen as C#.

Current unity simulation status can be checked from [Simulation Stages](https://github.com/onurulusoy4/DustBusterAI/tree/master/Pre-Simulations/DustBusterAI%20Unity%20Simulation)

**Note:** Pre Simulations in Unity Engine is over, we jumped into developing ROS environment using Gazebo and RViz tools. [DustBusterAI-Software](https://github.com/onurulusoy4/DustBusterAI-Software)
